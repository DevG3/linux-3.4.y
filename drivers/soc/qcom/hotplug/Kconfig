	help
	  Generic Alucard-hotplug cpu hotplug driver for ARM SOCs

+config ZEN_DECISION
 	bool "Zen Decision MPDecision Replacement"
 	depends on SMP && FB
 	default n
	help
 	  MPDecision is a userspace service that does several functions
 	  related to CPU Frequency and CPU Hotplugging. Some of these are:
 	  - Remove cores when screen goes off
 	  - Enable cores when screen goes on
 	  - Raise CPU_MIN_FREQ to a fixed value for a few seconds on input
   
 	  Zen Decision allows some of the MPDecison functions to be delegated
 	  to the kernel. Right now these are
 	  - Remove cores when screen goes off (after a configurable amount of time)
 	  - Enable cores when screen comes on (immediately)
 
 	  Zen Decision assumes the input boost function of MPDecision should be
 	  delegated to somewhere else in the kernel (Such as in CPU-BOOST)
 
 	  Enable this if you'd like the ability to disable MPDecision.
